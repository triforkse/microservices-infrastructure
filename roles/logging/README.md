## Logstash

Logging role for deploying and managing [Logstash](http://logstash.net) 1.5 with Docker and systemd.

Containers with Logstash are started on each host and collect logs from multiple inputs. 
This allows us to filter the logs and send them to a central location. At this time we support 
several outputs such as HDFS and [Logentries](https://logentries.com/). Though, by default all 
logs are sent to STDOUT as the HDFS role is still under development.
